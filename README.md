Spree Store Locator
===================

Do you have physical stores? This extension is for you! Tell your
customers where they can get your products.

It adds an admin option to easily create Store Locations.

It uses [jQuery Store Locator Plugin](https://github.com/bjorn2404/jQuery-Store-Locator-Plugin) to allow your users to find the stores by providing an address or zip code.

Installation
------------

Add spree_store_locator to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_store_locator',  github: 'ronzalo/spree_store_locator' , branch: '3-0-stable'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_store_locator:install
```

Customization
-------------

All the markup needed for jQuery Store Locator Plugin is in the
`app/views/spree/stores/index.html.haml`. If you want to customize the
Store Locator, you might need to override this view.

If you don't need to customize a lot, you might want to add some basic
styling.

Keep in mind that the following markup is mandatory:

```haml
#form-container
  %form#user-location{action: "#", method: "post"}
    #form-input
      %label{for: "address"} Enter Address or Zip Code:
      %input#address{name: "address", type: "text"}/
    %button#submit{type: "submit"} Submit
#map-container
  #loc-list
    %ul#list
  #map
```

If you want to customize the plugin functionality, then you will need to
override the `:coffescript` section. [Here](http://www.bjornblog.com/web/jquery-store-locator-plugin) are some examples and the full list of available options of the plugin.

You also can override the `templates` that the plugin uses for
dinamically generate the `Stores List`. Those templates are located on
your `public/templates` folder. After running the installation generator
of course.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_store_locator/factories'
```
